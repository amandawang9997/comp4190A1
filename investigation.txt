During the experiment, we observed that, in general, the arc consistency algorithm performs
significantly better than the backtracking algorithm. It is also quite surprising that the
number of nodes visited remains almost the same when the arc consistency algorithm is used.
On the contrary, the number increases exponentially when the backtracking algorithm is used.
Additionally, the most constrained heuristic is the most efficient one. When puzzle's dimen
-sion is fixed, if we have more walls (constraints), then the number of nodes visited will be
reduced. On average, the arc consistency algorithm visits 2059% less nodes.
